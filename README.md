# String symmetry checker
Checks if a word or sentence is spelled the same way both reading it forward and reading it backward.
It ignores punctuation, case, and spacing.

For example, with strings like the ones bellow, the function will return true or false:

"madam"
"_madam"
"racecar"
"not a symmetry"
"civic"
"deified"
"0_0 (; [-] ;) 0-0"
